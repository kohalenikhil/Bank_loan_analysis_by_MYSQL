# Bank_loan_analysis_by_MYSQL
I have performed some queries on bank loan analysis:

#1 Calculate the average annual income for fully paid loans
#2 Find the loan with the highest total payment
#3 Count the number of loans for each sub-grade
#4 Calculate the total loan amount for each verification status
#5 Calculate the total payments made for fully paid loans
#6 Count the number of loans for each loan purpose
#7 Identify loans with an interest rate greater than 15% and a loan amount less than 20,000
#8 Count the number of loans for each loan status
